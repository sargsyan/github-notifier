## Instructions for playing with source code

### Prerequisites

```sh
make install
```

```

### Configurations

The application is designed to run for multiple github instances on the same time.One instance is github.com the others are github enterprise instances.

```sh
./configure.sh
````

### Testing

If something is not working in your system and you are sure that configurations are correct you can run unit tests for your system to see if system behaves correctly. For this you need to install test framework shell scripts and run unit tests locally

```sh
brew install shunit2
make test
```

### Troubleshooting

To check the daemon logs for the error, use

```sh
tail -f /var/log/system.log
```

If the system logs tell that the application keeps exiting with non-zero exit codes, use
```sh
cat ~/Library/Logs/github_notif/service.log
```
Or locate github_notif folder in the Mac [Console application](https://support.apple.com/guide/console/welcome/mac).

```sh
ls /usr/local/Cellar/github-notifier/ #To get the current version
vi /usr/local/Cellar/github-notifier/<current_version>/lib/github_notif
```
